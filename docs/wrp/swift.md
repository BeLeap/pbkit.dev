[wrp-swift](https://github.com/pbkit/wrp-swift) is a swift implementation for WRP.\
wrp-swift leverages SwiftProtobuf and GRPC-Swift for en(de)coding messages with protocol buffers.

## Prerequisites
The current implementation of wrp-swift strongly uses the latest asynchronous model of Swift (like [AsyncSequence](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/asyncsequence)).
So we recommend to use wrp-swift at least with iOS 13.0+.
