**pbkit** is a collection of next-generation tools related to protobuf.

It is written in **TypeScript** and uses the **Deno API**.

However, it can be executed in **any JavaScript environment** (including Node.js or
web browser) because it does not use platform APIs inside the `core` directory.


## What is Protobuf?

<https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers>

> Protocol buffers are Google's language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible
> mechanism for serializing structured data â€“ think XML, but smaller, faster,
> and simpler.

## What features are provided?

### CLI

- `pb` - Protobuf schema compiler like `protoc`.
  - `protoc` has native binary dependencies, but `pb` command is written in pure
    TypeScript, so it can be used comfortably in Node.js projects, etc., and can
    even easily be run in a web browser.
  - [How to install and how to use](/docs/getting-started/installation)
- `pollapo` - A package manager for the protobuf schema.
  - A GitHub repository of `.proto` files is treated as a single pollapo
    package.
